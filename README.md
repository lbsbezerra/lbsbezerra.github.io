# Pokemon TCG Questions Party Game!
Hello, this is the repo for my personal Party Games to play with my friends, with our Pokemon TCG cards.

Current pending to finish:
- add one image for each one of the question cards;
- fix design in iOS apps (so the white bar above is not shown, and instead it is a dark one in my test iPhone 14 Pro);
- define "game finished, restart game?" screen (today it is happening in the last question instead of separated one).
- separate HTML, css, JS, for better maintenance, and clean-up the codebase.
- make the design responsive for iPad as well
